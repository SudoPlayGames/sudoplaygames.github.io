  - title: Axion
    desc: Axion is a Java library for manipulating NBT. Axion can use multiple configurations and supports the original spec and a custom extended spec right out of the box. The library provides an interface that can easily be extended to add NBT serialization support to your custom classes and object to NBT mapper utilities that can be registered with Axion when implementation of the aforementioned interface is impossible.

  - title: Joise
    desc: Joise is a 2D, 3D, 4D and 6D modular noise library written in Java. Joise was derived from <a href="http://accidentalnoise.sourceforge.net/index.html">Joshua Tippetts' C++ Accidental Noise Library</a> to facilitate the creation of complex noise functions from chained modules, and represent the chained modules in a consistent, ordered format for serialization.

  - title: SudoMath
    desc: SudoMath is a collection of math classes used at SudoPlay Games. It contains classes for manipulating vectors and matrices (<a href="https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine">jMonkeyEngine</a>), for performing Delaunay Triangulation (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/jdt/">jdt</a>), and for implementing quick, pluggable easing functions (<a href="http://www.robertpenner.com/easing/">Robert Penner</a>). SudoMath also contains classes for performing hexagonal grid calculations (<a href="http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/">RedBlobGames</a>) and lookup-table classes for faster sin, cos, and atan2 functions (<a href="http://riven8192.blogspot.com/">Riven's Blog</a>).
