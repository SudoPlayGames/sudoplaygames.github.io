Changelog for v0.0.757a.

This update contains a lot of changes to the core tech and file structure of the game. The changes are too numerous to try and remember / list them all. You might notice that the unit sprite style has changed and the tiles are now hexagonal. We also switched to a new, modified, third-party GUI library. One of the last notable changes is the way modding works. More on this as it stabilizes.

**WARNING:** This update has numerous bugs with certain game seeds. We're working through those right away.
