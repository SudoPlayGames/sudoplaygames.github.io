…a couple shots of the first iteration of the lighting engine.

Since the entire game premise is built around light, this **will not do**.  Notice the diamond patterns created by the basic flood fill / neighbor check algorithm.

**Disclaimer:** The textures are placeholder textures I found on a [Minecraft forum][1]. Unfortunately I do not remember which pack the textures came from. The textures are for testing only and *will not be used*.
