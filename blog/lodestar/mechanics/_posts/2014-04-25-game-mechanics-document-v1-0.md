I haven't updated in a while because I haven't written any code or produced any flashy images.

What?!?!

Instead, I decided that it was high time I sat down and wrote a document outlining the inner workings of absolutely every mechanic and all the math required to support those mechanics.

We now have a 63 page game mechanics document! Over sixty pages of rules, tables, lists and math!

I have no doubt that everything will need to be tweaked, massaged, and finessed before an accurate final version can be announced, but having this document will dramatically decrease development time. I found that without a clear definition of mechanics, I was spending too much time redesigning and refactoring; one step forward, slip and fall on face.

If you hit the ground running and have no clear destination, you're likely to run in the wrong direction. Knowing roughly where you're going is more important than knowing how you're going to get there.
