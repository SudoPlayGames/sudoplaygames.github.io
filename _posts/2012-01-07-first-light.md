…a couple shots of the first iteration of the lighting engine.

[<img src="first-light-1.png" width="300" height="225" />](first-light-1.png){: data-lightbox="group"}
[<img src="first-light-2.png" width="300" height="225" />](first-light-2.png){: data-lightbox="group"}

Since the entire game premise is built around light, this **will not do**.  Notice the diamond patterns created by the basic flood fill / neighbor check algorithm.

**Disclaimer:** The textures are placeholder textures I found on a Minecraft forum: <http://www.planetminecraft.com/resources/texture_packs/>  
Unfortunately I do not remember which pack the textures came from. The textures are for testing only and *will not be used*.
