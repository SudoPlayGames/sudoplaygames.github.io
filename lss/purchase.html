Just keep in mind that while this will give you the gist, you’re still agreeing to the whole thing, so you might want to read it just in case you’re thinking of being mischievous.</p>  <p>The stuff you buy from us might still be in development and may contain bugs and errors. Additionally, we really want to keep developing our stuff and providing you with updates, however we provide these updates as a bonus and cannot guarantee we will be able to continue providing updates or be able to provide the updates on any kind of regular schedule.</p>  <p>We don’t want you to sell or copy our stuff, or use our stuff to hurt or upset other people. Don’t just rip-off our assets or content and claim it as your own either. That’s not cool.</p>  <p>We want you to have fun with our stuff, and we don’t mind if you want to modify the scripts or make your own content, in fact, we encourage it. As long as you keep what you make free and don’t distribute the stuff that’s not meant to be modified, we are probably OK with it.</p>  <p>We at SudoPlay Games believe that it’s not a single idea that makes something great. It’s the execution and delivery of many ideas and those ideas can improve, but only if people are freely allowed to shape new ideas from the existing ideas. We have a lot of great ideas and goals for our stuff and we’re always thinking about developing and implementing new ideas. We realize, however, that disputes can arise when two parties claim to have come up with the same idea at the same time or when someone’s idea is inspired by another’s. So, to prevent these kind of disputes and to promote inspiration and sharing of ideas within the community, we decided that if you make something with our stuff or for use with our stuff, like a script, and you make this thing available, you give us and others in the community permission to freely use, copy, modify and adapt that idea. You will still own the code or content, but not the idea. Now, keep in mind that this means that we might use your idea, or a similar idea, in official versions of our stuff, and you may or may not receive credit for it. So, in short, we’re not going to steal your code, but if we like your idea, we may be inspired to implement it in our own way.</p>  <p>If you want to do something, but aren’t sure about it, ask us!</p>  <hr />  <p>THIS SOFTWARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT (“AGREEMENT”) IS A BINDING LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU (“YOU,” AND “YOUR”) AND SUDOPLAY GAMES (“SUDOPLAY,” “WE,” “US,” AND “OUR”) AND APPLIES TO YOUR PURCHASE OF ANY SOFTWARE OR OTHER SERVICES OR PRODUCTS SOLD OR MARKETED BY SUDOPLAY (THE “SOFTWARE”), INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO MUSIC, AUDIO, GRAPHICS, TEXTURES, SHADERS, AND TEXT PACKAGED WITH THE SOFTWARE (A “SOFTWARE ASSET,” THE “SOFTWARE ASSETS”).
